  5: == What is Trans-Out at DCA6? ==
  6: 
  7: Trans-Out is the process of sending freight from our facility to another Amazon facility.
  8: Currently, DCA6 is sending out Team Lift and Sortable items; with Team Lift being sent to AVP3 or RIC3 and Sortables being sent to DCA1, BDL3, or BWI2.
  9: 
 10: **Always confirm** the destination with Receive Management before beginning the Trans-Out process.
 11: 
 12: == Permissions Needed ==
 13: 
 14: You'll need a few permissions to complete the Trans-Out Process.

 21: 
 22: == Verify Inventory ==
 23: 
 24: Before anything is sent to another facility, the inventory must be verified. Check for correct quantities, correct ASIN and that the item is meant for Trans-Out.

 56: 
 57: Once inventory is verified, building the pallet can begin. Use caution when stacking items, always bend at the knees and lift in the power zone.

113: == Move Pallets to the Trailer **Physically** and **Virtually** ==
114: 
115: Typically, an empty trailer can hold 30 pallets single stacked, 60 if double stacked.
116: 
117: Because Team Lift items usually have some overhang you may not be able to fit 30 pallets in the trailer. The best practice is to start with about 20 pallets and then load more if possible.
118: 
119: If stacking tote pallets, the best practice is to have one pallet of 5 high totes and one pallet of 4 high totes for better clearance when loading the trailer. 
120: **Always** ensure stacked pallets are tightly wrapped. While possible, it is **not** recommended to double stack Team Lift pallets due to their weight and vulnerability to falling during transport.
121: 
122: **Always** verify TDR has been completed before entering a trailer.

139: 
140: Verify the Inventory of the pallet being moved has not been deleted.
